# Unsupervised Package
## Walter Arboleda Casta√±eda - Machine Learnig II - UdeA - 2023

**Description:**

This package contains the implementation of three algorithms for dimensionality reduction:
- SVD
- PCA
- TSNE

**Details:**
- SVD algorithm was implemented with two methos: power iterate as principal method and calculating the right and left eigenvalues and vectors as auxiliar method. This is because in tests in the power iterate method only worked with sqare matrices.
- PCA was computed by centralizing the data,  calculating  eigenvalues and vectors and covariance matrix 
- TSNE was computed following the traditional definition
- SVD and PCA have fit(), transform() and fit_transform() methods, TSNE only has fit_transform() method due its algorithm characteristics 

**Dependences:**

The package is builing with poetry with the next dependences:
- python = "^3.10"
- scikit-learn = "^1.2.2"

**Usage:**

In the dist folder you can find the .whl and .gz files for package instalation
- uns_package-0.1.0-py3-none-any.whl (windows)
- uns_package-0.1.0.tar.gz (linux, mac)

```python
#Example:

# X ndarray with input data

# SVD
from uns_package.SVD import SVD
svd = SVD(method='eig')
svd.fit(A)
u, sigma, vt = svd.transform()
print("U")
print(u)
print("Sigma")
print(sigma)
print("V")
print(vt)

#PCA
from uns_package.PCA import PCA
pca = PCA(n_components=2)
pca.fit(X)
pca = PCA(n_components=2)
pca.fit(X)
print(pca.cumulative_variance)
print(pca.explained_variance)
pca_data = pca.transform(X)
print(pca_data)

#TSNE
from uns_package.TSNE import TSNE

tsne = TSNE(n_components=2)
tsne_data = tsne.fit_transform(X)
print(tsne_data)


```
